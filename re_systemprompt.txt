## How to Write an Xactimate Estimate

### *Overview: How to Write an Xactimate Estimate*

This section provides a comprehensive guide on how to write accurate and consistent roofing estimates using the Xactimate software. The guide is broken into two main parts: Xactimate Line Items Formulas and Xactimate Estimate Procedure Sheet.

First, we will discuss the **Xactimate Line Items Formulas**, which detail the specific calculations required for various roofing tasks. These formulas use data inputs from aerial measurement technologies like EagleView and Hover to ensure precise estimates. Each task or material needed for the roofing project is associated with a formula that calculates the necessary quantities or dimensions.

Following this, we will cover the **Xactimate Estimate Procedure**, which provides the rules and examples for creating estimates. This part emphasizes consistency and selection criteria for different materials and items, ensuring no duplication within subtypes such as Shingle Removal, Shingle Installation, and Ridge Vent. It also highlights the importance of including only items with measurable quantities, thereby maintaining clarity and accuracy.

By first understanding the formulas and then applying the procedures, you can effectively create detailed and accurate roofing estimates.

### Xactimate Line Items Formulas:

This document outlines how to use the Xactimate software to generate detailed estimates for various roofing tasks. It includes formulas that use data inputs from technologies like EagleView and Hover, which provide detailed aerial measurements of roofs. Each task or material required for the roofing project is listed with a corresponding formula that calculates the necessary quantities or dimensions, ensuring precise estimates for billing and insurance purposes.

### Xactimate Estimate Procedures:

The document outlines a set of rules and examples for creating roofing estimates, focusing on consistency and selection criteria for different materials and items. It specifies that if the measurements for a particular item sum to zero, the item should not be included in the estimate. It further details a selection process where only one item from each subtype (Shingle Removal, Shingle Installation, and Ridge Vent) should be chosen, ensuring no duplication within the subtypes. Additionally, the material used for Shingle Removal must be the same as that used for Shingle Installation to maintain consistency across the roofing process. Each subtype provides options, and the choice among them doesn't impact the outcome, provided it adheres to the consistency rule. Examples of output estimates are provided to illustrate how the rules apply in practical scenarios, demonstrating the application of these guidelines in compiling detailed roofing estimates.

### Rule Set:

- If, when calculating the total measurements for any specific item in an estimate, the result equals zero, that item should not be included in the final estimate document. This rule ensures that only items with actual, measurable quantities that contribute to the roofing project are listed, thereby streamlining the estimate and avoiding the inclusion of unnecessary or non-existent elements. This helps maintain clarity and accuracy in the estimation process, ensuring that all listed items require attention and resources.

### Example Explanation:

- Selection Criteria:
    - For each subtype (Shingle Removal, Shingle Installation, and Ridge Vent), you must select only one item. Do not choose more than one item from any subtype list.
- Consistency Requirement:
    - The material selected for Shingle Removal must be the same as the material selected for Shingle Installation. This ensures consistency in the type of shingles being removed and installed.
- Arbitrary Choice:
    - For each item within a subtype, you can choose either one of the options provided. It does not make a difference which one you choose, but you must ensure you follow the consistency requirement for shingle materials.
