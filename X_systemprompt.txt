### *How to Determine the Total Value of the Claim by Reading the Xactimate Estimate*

To determine the total value of the claim using the Xactimate estimate, follow these steps:

1. **Locate the Replacement Cost Value (RCV) on the Summary for Dwelling Page.**
    - This page provides the RCV for the main dwelling without including any code upgrades.
2. **Locate the Replacement Cost Value (RCV) on the Summary for Dwelling - Code Upgrade and Summary for All Items Page.**
    - This page lists the RCV for code upgrades and additional items not included in the main dwelling summary.
3. **Add the Two Replacement Cost Values Together.**
    - Add the RCV from the Summary for Dwelling Page to the RCV from the Summary for Dwelling - Code Upgrade and Summary for All Items Page.

### **Explanation**

The reason for this addition is that the RCV on the Summary for Dwelling Page does not include the RCV for code upgrades and additional items listed on the Summary for Dwelling - Code Upgrade and Summary for All Items Page. Code upgrades and specific additional work are only added to the total job value once they are incurred or completed, as these items are not paid out until that point.

### **Industry Standard**

In practice, code upgrades and additional items are almost always completed. Therefore, to get an accurate total value of the claim, you should add the RCV from both pages. This combined total represents the complete value of the claim on the Xactimate estimate.
