### *Overview: How to Write a Roofing or Siding Xactimate Estimate*

This section provides a comprehensive guide on how to write accurate and consistent Siding estimates using the Xactimate software. The guide is broken into two main parts: Xactimate Line Items Formulas and Xactimate Estimate Procedure Sheet.

First, we will discuss the **Xactimate Line Items Formulas**, which detail the specific calculations required for various Siding or Roofing tasks. These formulas use data inputs from aerial measurement technologies Hover to ensure precise estimates. Each task or material needed for the Siding project is associated with a formula that calculates the necessary quantities or dimensions.

By first understanding the formulas and then applying the procedures, you can effectively create detailed and accurate Siding or Roofing estimates.

## Roofing Xactimate Estimates

1. **Remove 3 tab - 25 yr. - composition shingle roofing**

    - The area for roofing felt is derived similarly to shingle removal and installation.

    - **Hover Formula:** Roof Facets × 0.01

8. **Ice & water barrier**

    - The quantity of ice and water barrier needed is based on the combined linear measurements of valleys and eaves.

    - **Hover Formula:** Valleys + Eaves

9. **R&R Continuous ridge vent - aluminum**

    - The ridge vent calculation uses the total length of ridges or hips.

    - **Hover Formula:** Ridges / Hips

10. **R&R Continuous ridge vent - shingle-over style**

    - Calculations involve the total length of ridges or the combined length of ridges and hips.

    - **Hover Formula:** Ridges / Hips (note / is not divided symbol, Ridges / Hips is the name of the entire variable)

11. **R&R Ridge cap - composition shingles**

    - For ridge caps, the formula is based on the length of ridges and/or hips.

    - **Hover Formula:** Ridges / Hips (note / is not divided symbol, Ridges / Hips is the name of the entire variable)

12. **R&R Drip edge**

### Xactimate Roofing Estimate Procedures:

The document outlines a set of rules and examples for creating roofing estimates, focusing on consistency and selection criteria for different materials and items. It specifies that if the measurements for a particular item sum to zero, the item should not be included in the estimate. It further details a selection process where only one item from each subtype (Shingle Removal, Shingle Installation, and Ridge Vent) should be chosen, ensuring no duplication within the subtypes. Additionally, the material used for Shingle Removal must be the same as that used for Shingle Installation to maintain consistency across the roofing process. Each subtype provides options, and the choice among them doesn't impact the outcome, provided it adheres to the consistency rule. Examples of output estimates are provided to illustrate how the rules apply in practical scenarios, demonstrating the application of these guidelines in compiling detailed roofing estimates.

### Rule Set For Roofing Estimates:

- If, when calculating the total measurements for any specific item in an estimate, the result equals zero, that item should not be included in the final estimate document. This rule ensures that only items with actual, measurable quantities that contribute to the roofing project are listed, thereby streamlining the estimate and avoiding the inclusion of unnecessary or non-existent elements. This helps maintain clarity and accuracy in the estimation process, ensuring that all listed items require attention and resources.

### Example Explanation For Roofing Estimates:

- Selection Criteria:

    - For each subtype (Shingle Removal, Shingle Installation, and Ridge Vent), you must select only one item. Do not choose more than one item from any subtype list.

- Consistency Requirement:

    - The material selected for Shingle Removal must be the same as the material selected for Shingle Installation. This ensures consistency in the type of shingles being removed and installed.

- Arbitrary Choice:

    - For each item within a subtype, you can choose either one of the options provided. It does not make a difference which one you choose, but you must ensure you follow the consistency requirement for shingle materials.

- For Shingle Removal:

    - *The material chosen for shingle removal must match the material chosen for shingle installation*

        - Option 1: Remove 3 tab - 25 yr. - composition shingle roofing

        - Option 2: Remove Laminated - comp. shingle rfg. - w/ felt

- For Shingle Installation:

    - *The material chosen for shingle installation must match the material chosen for shingle removal.*

        - Option 1: 3 tab - 25 yr. - composition shingle roofing

        - Option 2: Laminated - comp. shingle rfg. - w/out felt

- For Ridge Vent:

    - *Select one of the following options for the ridge vent:*

        - Option 1: R&R Continuous ridge vent - aluminum

        - Option 2: R&R Continuous ridge vent - shingle-over style

### Xactimate Line Items Formulas For Siding Estimates:

This document outlines how to use the Xactimate software to generate detailed estimates for various Siding tasks. It includes formulas that use data inputs from technologies like Hover, which provide detailed aerial measurements of roofs. Each task or material required for the siding project is listed with a corresponding formula that calculates the necessary quantities or dimensions, ensuring precise estimates for billing and insurance purposes.

1. **R&R Siding - aluminum (.024 thickness)**

    - The calculation for R&R Siding - aluminum (.024 thickness) is based on multiplying the total Total Siding Facades by 1.

    - **Hover Formula:** Facades × 1.00

2. **House wrap (air/moisture barrier)**

    - The calculation for **House wrap (air/moisture barrier)** is based on multiplying the total Total Siding Facades by 1.

    - **Hover Formula:** Facades × 1.00

3. **Fanfold foam insulation board - 3/8"**

    - The calculation for **Fanfold foam insulation board - 3/8"** is based on multiplying the total Total Siding Facades by 1.

    - **Hover Formula:** Facades × 1.00

4. **Scaffolding setup and take down - (per hour/section)**

    - To calculate the scaffolding setup and takedown time per hour/section, first identify all elevations under the siding. Exclude any elevation that is less than 50 square feet. For each elevation that is 50 square feet or larger, add 2 hours to the total time. In other words, only consider elevations that meet or exceed 50 square feet, and for each of these valid elevations, add 2 hours to the overall scaffolding setup and takedown time.

    - **Hover Formula:** (Number of siding elevations that are 50 square feet or larger) × 2.00 Hours
