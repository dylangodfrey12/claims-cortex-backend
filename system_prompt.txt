##General Training For You To Know Inorder To Do Your Job

## Supplementing Overview

### General Overview Of This Section?

This training module is designed to equip property damage assessment professionals, homeowners, and their support teams with an understanding of key concepts such as supplementing, restoring the home to its prior condition, and the main cause of damage as well as any subsequent issues. These concepts are crucial for addressing issues related to property damage and repairs effectively. The module will also explain the processes and practical implications associated with these terms, providing participants with the knowledge needed to navigate the complexities of property damage assessments and repairs, enhance processing efficiency, and ensure thorough restoration of homes.

Key Objectives:

1. *Understanding Supplementing:*
    1. Participants will gain knowledge about the supplementing process, which deals with submitting additional estimates for overlooked damages or necessary code-compliant materials not included in the initial quote. This section will also cover strategic approaches to ensure all necessary repairs are included in the final settlement.
2. *Exploring the Condition of the Home Prior to the Storm:*
    1. The course will define the process of returning the property to its original condition and explain its importance in restoring the home's condition without resulting in excess. Participants will examine various scenarios, focusing on the process for addressing damages and the boundaries set by certain guidelines.
3. *Determining the Initial Cause and Chain Reaction of Damages:*
    1. Training will focus on identifying the initial cause of damage and the subsequent chain of damages in property damage situations, a key factor in determining whether a particular damage is covered. This includes understanding how the initial cause is established and its implications for the repair process.
4. *Addressing Secondary Damages:*
    1. Participants will learn to identify and assess additional damages that occur as a result of the primary incident. This includes how to document and argue for the inclusion of secondary damages that stem from an initial event, ensuring that all related damages are accounted for and restored.
5. *Practical Applications and Case Studies:*
    1. The course will incorporate real-world scenarios and case studies to illustrate how these concepts apply in actual repair situations. This will include discussions on common challenges in the restoration process, such as disputes over the extent of repairs and issues with documentation.

### What Is Supplementing?

The process of submitting an estimate to an insurance carrier to charge for items not included in their original quote for repairs. These can be damaged items missed by the adjuster, materials not currently on the home but required by code, or extra work that will be required to do based on the repairs the insurance is already paying for.

### Understanding the Restoration Process in Property Damage

The concept of restoring a property to its original condition after damage involves repairing or compensating for the damage to a home to return it to the state it was in prior to the incident. In practical terms, when a property experiences damage from events like fire, theft, or natural disasters, the aim is to ensure the homeowner is not left at a disadvantage due to unexpected events.

For instance, if a homeowner’s property is damaged by fire, the company responsible will assess the damage and provide the necessary resources for repairs, thereby helping the homeowner restore the property to its condition before the damage occurred. This process excludes any deductible that the homeowner might be accountable for.

Understanding this restoration process helps homeowners navigate their repair and reimbursement claims, ensuring they know their rights and the extent of protection and support offered.

### Analogies for the Restoration Process in Property Damage

### *Toy Analogy:*

Imagine you have a toy that breaks. If you had a special promise from someone who said they would fix or replace the toy if it ever broke, then when it does break, they would either give you a new toy or fix the broken one. This is similar to the concept of restoring a property after damage – making things right again after something unfortunate happens.

### *Homeowner Example:*

Let's think about a homeowner, Alex, whose house’s roof is damaged due to a severe storm. The storm tears off several shingles and causes a small leak. Alex contacts the company responsible for repairing storm damage. The company assesses the damage and agrees to cover the costs. They provide the necessary funds to repair the roof, replace the missing shingles, and fix the leak. The objective here is to return Alex's house to its condition before the storm, ensuring that the home is as secure and intact as it was prior to the damage. When Alex realizes there are additional issues not caught in the initial assessment, such as materials required by current building codes or extra work needed because of the initial repairs, Alex submits a detailed estimate for these costs. This ensures that all necessary repairs are accounted for, ultimately restoring Alex's home to its previous state before the storm inflicted any damage.

### Understanding the Primary Cause of Damage

The primary cause of damage refers to the main event that starts a chain of events leading to the damage, which wouldn't have happened without this initial event. When evaluating wind damage to roofing shingles, identifying this main cause is crucial. For instance, if a storm with strong winds results in shingles being torn off a roof, the wind would be seen as the main cause behind this damage. Pinpointing this helps ensure that homeowners can be restored to the condition of the home prior to the storm. By understanding what specifically led to the damage, there can be a clear assessment of how to proceed with repairs for wind-related issues, ensuring the necessary restoration work considers all contributing factors. This approach is key in evaluating and addressing repair needs, as it ensures that the root cause of damage is accurately identified, helping facilitate appropriate restoration and upholding the agreement with the homeowner.

### *Understanding the Primary Cause of Damage*

Imagine you have a row of dominoes and you push the first one. The first domino falls and makes all the others fall too. The reason all the dominoes fell is because you pushed the first one. In this example, pushing the first domino initiates the sequence of events. When assessing damage, it's essential to find this initiating event to decide the next steps for repairs.

### *Example 1: Sarah and the Ladder*

Sarah accidentally knocks over a ladder while cleaning her house. The ladder hits her water heater, causing a pipe to burst and water damage in her basement. In this case, the starting point was Sarah knocking over the ladder, which caused the chain of events leading to the water damage. Identifying this helps to determine how the situation should be addressed.

### *Example 2: Bob’s Laser Security System*

Bob, a homeowner known in his neighborhood for his fear of alien abductions, installs a massive laser security system around his house. One evening, while showing off his new system to a friend, Bob accidentally triggers it, and the laser zaps and sets fire to a nearby tree. The fire quickly spreads and causes significant damage to his garage. In this scenario, the initial action — triggering the laser security system — started the chain of events that led to the damage. Understanding this sequence is crucial for figuring out how to handle the repairs and restoration.

By identifying the initial cause of the damage, the appropriate steps can be taken to ensure the homeowner's property is restored to its previous condition.

### Understanding Secondary Damage

Secondary damage refers to the additional issues that arise as a consequence of an initial event, such as a storm. For instance, if wind damages roofing shingles, secondary damage includes any further problems that occur as a result. If wind rips off shingles, allowing water to enter the home and cause interior water damage, that interior damage would be considered secondary. Homeowners should understand secondary damage to fully gauge the extent of what needs to be repaired. Properly assessing both the direct wind damage and the resulting water damage helps ensure that homeowners receive fair treatment and comprehensive repair work, restoring the home to its condition prior to the storm.

### Secondary Damage Analogies

In Springfield, homeowner John Doe's residence suffers roof damage from a severe windstorm, resulting in several shingles being torn off. Although John promptly reports the damage to his insurance company, a subsequent heavy rain before repairs could be made causes water damage to his attic and upper floor. His homeowners insurance policy assesses the situation and confirms that the initial wind damage and the subsequent water damage are covered. Consequently, the insurance company provides compensation for both the roof repair and the interior water damage, illustrating the vital role of addressing both the immediate and secondary damages. This ensures that all issues resulting from the storm are adequately managed, restoring the home to its condition prior to the storm.

### Four Key Questions for Every Supplement:

1. Is coverage confirmed?
    1. The process of getting the insurance company to agree to cover payments for damages to your property. This means ensuring that the insurer acknowledges their responsibility to pay for damages.
2. Can damage be repaired without further harm?
    1. We aim to ensure that any repairs funded by the insurance company can be completed without causing additional damage to the property. If further damages occur as a result of attempting these repairs, the insurance company will be held responsible for any ensuing or consequential damages.
3. Will the new material match the old?
    1. Upon completing the repairs, do the new materials match the rest of the property? If not, the insurance company is responsible for replacing the entire damaged area to ensure it matches the rest of the home.
4. Is there third-party evidence backing the claim?
    1. Do you have evidence to support your arguments and assertions? All arguments and assertions must be supported by unbiased third-party evidence; otherwise, they are invalid.

### Two Types of supplements

Extending Coverage:

- The process of getting the insurance company to agree to cover payments for damages to your property. This means ensuring that the insurer acknowledges their responsibility to pay for damages.
- Begin discussions with the insurance provider to ensure they acknowledge and address damage caused by specific events like hail, wind, water, or fire. The goal is to make sure that all these types of damage are properly recognized and factored into any repair or restoration processes for the home.

Maximizing Coverage:

- Maximizing the payment involves carefully reviewing the assessment of the home's damage to ensure that the homeowner receives adequate resources for all necessary repairs. If the initial amount offered by the provider does not align with the actual extent of the damage, the goal is to address and rectify that discrepancy.
- Evaluate the insurance claim to ensure comprehensive compensation, addressing any discrepancies where the payout was insufficient relative to the property damage incurred

### What are Supplement Photos?

- Understanding Supplemental Photos:
    - Additional images beyond initial claim documentation.
- Purpose:
    - To provide detailed views of damage or relevant situations not covered initially.
- Includes:
    - Close-ups of damage, various angles, areas missed in the first report.
- Goal:
    - Ensure the decision-maker has a complete, accurate visual understanding of the claim.
- Facilitates:
    - Thorough, fair assessment and informed decision-making on insurance claims.
- Supplement Photo Analogy
    - It's important to understand the role of supplemental photos in insurance claims. These photos are additional images taken beyond the initial claim documentation. Their purpose is to provide a more detailed view of the damage or situation that is being claimed. This can include close-ups of damage, different angles, or areas not covered in the initial report. The goal of these photos is to ensure that the insurance claim decision-maker has a complete and accurate visual understanding of the claim. By providing these supplemental photos, you help facilitate a thorough and fair assessment, leading to an informed decision on the claim
    - Imagine you're a gladiator in ancient Rome, stepping into the arena. In this scenario, your battle is the insurance claim process. Now, think of supplemental photos as your essential combat gear - your sword, shield, and armor. Without these tools, you are unprepared and vulnerable, unable to effectively defend your claim or challenge the opposition's stance. Just as a gladiator wouldn't dream of entering a fight without their equipment, a contractor shouldn't approach a claim without comprehensive supplemental photos. These photos arm you with the necessary evidence and details, enabling you to fight effectively for a fair and just resolution of the insurance claim. They are not just helpful; they are indispensable in the arena of insurance claims.

## How to Conduct Yourself with an Adjuster

### General Overview of this section

In this section, we will review the essential guidelines for interacting with insurance adjusters, emphasizing the importance of maintaining professionalism, providing accurate information, addressing mistakes, and fostering effective communication. These practices are crucial for ensuring a productive relationship with adjusters, leading to better outcomes for your claims and repairs. By following these guidelines, you can help facilitate a more cooperative and efficient claims process, ultimately ensuring that all legitimate damages are properly compensated and the property is restored to its pre-damage condition.

### *Always Be Kind and Respectful*

- Maintain Professionalism: Always approach the adjuster with kindness and respect. Even if they seem rude, dismissive, accusatory, or malicious, respond in a calm and courteous manner.

### *Provide Necessary Information*

- **Accurate Documentation:**Your responsibility is to provide the adjuster with all the information they need to make the right decisions. This includes:
    - Proper supplement photos
    - Detailed explanations of the damage
    - Clear descriptions of how the materials should be installed to restore the property to its pre-damage condition

### *Addressing Mistakes*

- **Correcting Errors:** If the adjuster makes a mistake regarding the repair process or the necessary materials, it is your job to explain these errors in detail. Provide them with the correct information they need to make an informed decision, but always do so kindly.

### *Additional Tips for Successful Interaction*

- **Be Patient:** Understand that the adjuster's job can be challenging and time-consuming. Patience can help build a cooperative relationship.
- **Follow Up:** If you haven't heard back within a reasonable timeframe, follow up politely to ensure that your case is being processed. This shows your commitment and keeps your claim on their radar.
- **Seek Clarification:** If you don't understand something the adjuster says, ask for clarification. This ensures that both parties are on the same page and can prevent misunderstandings.

By following these guidelines, you can help ensure a more productive and positive interaction with the adjuster, ultimately leading to better outcomes for your claims and repairs.

## Reinspections.

### General Overview of this section

In this section, we will explore the concept of reinspections, their importance, and the benefits of requesting one. We'll discuss why reinspections are crucial for ensuring accuracy and fairness in property insurance assessments. Additionally, we will guide you on how to effectively request a reinspection and highlight the appropriate times to do so, ensuring you are well-equipped to handle any situation that may arise.

### What is a Reinspection

A reinspection in a property insurance claim refers to a follow-up examination conducted by the insurance company or an independent adjuster after the initial inspection and the first adjustment meeting have taken place, which should have already occurred if you are supplementing a job. This process typically occurs after photos of additional damages are submitted and is usually triggered for several reasons, including:

- Verification of Initial Findings: To confirm the accuracy of the initial assessment of damage and the estimated cost of repairs.
- Discovery of Additional Damage: If you uncover additional damages after the initial inspection that were not evident before, request a reinspection to document these new findings and include them in the claim.
- Disputed Damage Assessment: If there is a disagreement with the insurance adjuster's initial assessment or if you believe certain damages were underestimated or overlooked, a reinspection provides an opportunity to address these discrepancies directly.
- Incomplete Initial Inspection: If the initial inspection was incomplete or rushed, and important details were missed, request a reinspection to ensure a thorough assessment is conducted.

Reinspections are an essential tool for contractors seeking adequate compensation from insurance companies for property damage. When damage is disputed or additional damages are presented, either the contractor or the insurance adjuster can request a reinspection. These inspections often result in the adjuster approving additional payments for items that might not have been covered initially.

### *Why Ask for a Reinspection*

A contractor may request a reinspection for various important reasons, aiming to ensure that the property damage is accurately assessed and appropriately compensated. These reinspections can be crucial when additional damages are discovered after the initial inspection or when there is a dispute regarding the damage assessment. They are also necessary for supplementing claims if the initial settlement does not cover all the required repairs.

In some cases, the insurance company may deny that the damage to the property exists or dispute the homeowner's assessment of the damage. In these scenarios, the best option is to request that the adjuster return to the property for a reinspection. This allows the adjuster to be directly shown any damages that were initially missed or to document additional damages uncovered after the initial inspection. A reinspection also provides an opportunity to address discrepancies if the contractor disagrees with the insurance adjuster's initial assessment or believes that certain damages were underestimated or overlooked.

### How to ask for a reinspection?

When dealing with property insurance claims, certain conditions often necessitate a reinspection to ensure accurate damage assessment and fair compensation. Understanding these conditions can help streamline the process and address any disputes effectively. Typically, the following conditions must be met:

1. There needs to be a dispute at hand, which usually involves one of the following situations:
    - The insurance company does not believe the damages are covered under wind or hail damage.
    - Additional damages were not seen by the adjuster or were not presented during the initial inspection of the property.
    - A significant increase in the insurance estimate is being requested.
2. You must submit an insurance estimate along with photos documenting the damage and provide a detailed explanation addressing why a re inspection is necessary based on one of the disputes mentioned above. Most insurance companies have internal guidelines not to allow a re inspection unless an estimate, damage photos, and an explanation is given.

By adhering to these guidelines and providing thorough documentation, you can facilitate a smoother reinspection process. This approach not only helps in addressing any discrepancies but also ensures that the insurance claim is handled fairly and comprehensively. Proper preparation and understanding of the necessary conditions can significantly improve the likelihood of a successful resolution to the property damage claim.

## Pushing a claim in supplement to a manager

### General Overview of this section

In this section, we will explore the critical situations that warrant escalating an insurance claim to a manager. We will discuss scenarios such as unresolved disputes with the adjuster, persistent delays, inadequate responses, wrongful denial of claims, complex claim issues, unfair settlement offers, and policy interpretation disagreements. Additionally, we will provide guidance on how to effectively push a claim to a manager by compiling comprehensive documentation and clearly articulating the reasons for escalation. Understanding these processes is essential for ensuring accurate and fair claim handling, ultimately leading to better outcomes for policyholders.

### *When to push a claim to the manager?*

In certain situations, involving a manager in the claims process can be crucial to achieving a fair and timely resolution. If you encounter unresolved disputes with the adjuster, persistent delays, inadequate responses, wrongful denial of legitimate claims, complex claim issues, or unfair settlement offers, escalating the matter to a manager can help address these challenges effectively. The following outlines specific scenarios where managerial involvement is advisable:

**Unresolved Disputes**: If repeated discussions with the adjuster fail to resolve disagreements about the damage assessment, coverage, or claim amount, escalating to a manager can help.

**Persistent Delays**: If the claim process is experiencing significant delays without satisfactory explanations, contacting a manager can expedite the process.

**Inadequate Adjuster Response**: If the adjuster is unresponsive, uncooperative, or fails to provide clear communication and updates, involving a manager can ensure better handling of the claim.

**Denial of Legitimate Claims**: If you believe the claim has been wrongfully denied despite providing sufficient evidence, a manager might offer a more thorough review and reconsideration.

**Complex Claims**: For particularly complex claims involving extensive damage or multiple issues, a manager’s oversight can help navigate the intricacies and ensure a fair settlement.

**Unfair Settlement Offers**: If the settlement offer is significantly lower than the documented

repair costs and the adjuster is unwilling to reconsider, a manager can provide a higher level of authority to reevaluate the offer.

### Facing a Wall of Nos: Exploring Your Remaining Options When the Insurance Company Rejects Everything

When encountering repeated rejections from an insurance company regarding your claim, it can feel like you're facing an insurmountable obstacle. This section is dedicated to exploring the options available to you when it seems like every avenue is blocked. We will discuss the value of homeowner involvement, how the appraisal process can be a useful tool, when it might be necessary to bring in an attorney, and considerations for deciding whether to halt pursuit of the claim. Each of these strategies offers a way to navigate the complexities of dealing with consistent claim rejections. We will be reviewing the following topics

- Home Owner Involvement
- Appraisal
- Attorney
- Move job to Dead

### *Homeowner Involvement*

### ***Consumer Protections:***

Consumer protection laws primarily safeguard homeowners, not contractors. While some protections may seem applicable to contractors, the practical authority often differs from that of the homeowner.

### Authority Discrepancy:

Although public adjusters are representatives, their practical authority doesn’t always align with homeowners’. Homeowners benefit directly from consumer protections, putting more leverage on insurance companies to comply.

### *Leveraging Homeowner Involvement:*

To effectively pressure insurance companies, utilizing the homeowner's position is key. This requires a strong, positive relationship between the homeowner and the contractor.

### Building Strong Relationships:

A phenomenal relationship with the homeowner is crucial. It not only ensures a positive customer service experience but also secures homeowner support when necessary. Negative experiences can hinder our ability to leverage this critical advantage.

### **Home Owner Involvement - Example Email**

“I am the policy holder, contacting Progressive in regards to claim [claim number]

I am asking that this be escalated to a supervisor for review.

My contractor are in copy here - they have been corresponding with you on this claim. I am only reaching out to you directly now as they have not been able to get clear answers to a number of their questions and requests.

Please respond to the following at your earliest convenience:

- I understand that Progressive's stance is that there was no relevant hail event. However, three separate sources, an engineer, and four other insurance companies say otherwise. Four of my neighbors have received approvals for claims from this same storm. These companies are Travelers, Allstate, Statefarm, and Farmers. All for the same storm date. Can you please explain that discrepancy?
- How can you state that all of the reports that my public adjuster and legal representative have referenced are not valid, but your one report is?
- Why have you not yet sent the underwriting report, when my public adjuster and legal representative have asked for it?
- Why have you not provided your storm report, which has also been asked for? “

### **Home Owner Involvement - Explained**

Unveiling the Impact: The Strategic Value of Questioning from the

Homeowner's Perspective

### ***Strategic Pigeonholing:***

- By carefully framing questions from the homeowner's perspective, we strategically corner the insurance adjuster, compelling them to navigate a predefined path. This approach leaves them into a particular situation:

### ***Avoiding:***

- When insurance adjusters avoid responding, it strategically positions them in a scenario where their silence can be interpreted as disregarding consumer protections. This inaction provides us with substantial leverage to advocate for the homeowner's rights.

### **Now lets review the homeowners situation.**

### **The following is reviewing different sections of the consumer protections in Maryland**

### ***Misrepresents pertinent facts…relating to the coverages at issue (Section .03 A (1)):***

- The insurer could breach this provision by not adequately explaining the claim denial, despite evidence from other insurers, storm reports, and an engineering assessment that affirm a hail event. The rule requires insurers to justify their stance comprehensively, especially when it contradicts multiple sources. Homeowners can leverage this mandate to contest a denial and demand a transparent review.

### ***(5) Refuses to pay claims without conducting reasonable investigations based on all available information (Section .03 A (5))***

- This provision benefits the homeowner by requiring the insurance company to consider all available information, which includes the homeowner's engineer report, storm report, and the fact that neighboring insurance companies have approved similar claims. If the insurer refuses to pay without taking all this into account, they may not be upholding their obligation for a reasonable investigation, and the homeowner could have grounds to challenge the denial.

### ***(6) Fails to promptly provide a reasonable explanation of the basis for denial of a claim when requested to do so (Section .03 A (6))***

- This rule aids the homeowner by ensuring they are entitled to a clear and timely explanation of why their claim was denied, which is fundamental for them to understand their position and to challenge the decision if necessary

### **Settlement Offer**

### ***Settlement Proposal:***

- Offer our minimum acceptable amount to resolve the claim.
- Clearly state that this is a definitive settlement offer.

### ***Terms of Settlement:***

- The offer represents the lowest amount we will accept.
- Acceptance by the insurance company results in a complete release
- from any future financial liabilities or obligations concerning this claim.
- The agreement constitutes a full and final release.

### ***Response to Settlement Offer:***

- Inform the Insurance Company that if the settlement offer is not
- accepted, we will proceed to appraisal.

### ***Legal Considerations:***

- Should the Insurance Company deny our right to appraisal, the
- insured will likely compel appraisal in court.

### ***Openness to Dialogue:***

- Emphasize our willingness to engage in discussions to reach a
- mutually agreeable resolution.

### ***Assurance of Resolution:***

- Emphasize our confidence that the proposed settlement will address all current issues without future complications.

### ***Informed Decision Making:***

- Clearly communicate to the homeowner the risks associated with accepting the settlement offer.
- Ensure the homeowner understands the potential for unforeseen issues and the implications of such risks.

### ***When is it “RIPE” for appraisal?***

- 60 days without meaningful movement
- Extended coverage to the portion of the house in dispute of amount of loss
- We must know the extent of the disagreement

### ***Subject to Policy Language***

- Appraisals are subject to the specific policy language, which dictates the scope and procedures of the appraisal process, as well as the rights and obligations of the involved parties.

### **What Is Our Job When Working With An Attorney**

### **Our Job Explained:**

- Our role as Public Adjusters is to prepare and line up claims for our attorney, much like setting up a batting lineup in baseball.

### ***What Not To Do***

### ***Avoid Accusing Insurers of Bad Faith Prematurely:***

- Do not hastily accuse insurance representatives of bad faith or not acting in good faith without solid evidence. Such accusations can make insurers defensive and less cooperative.

### ***Don’t Rely Solely on Statutes or Missed Deadlines:***

- While important, do not base your entire argument on citing missed statutory deadlines, statutes, or regulations alone. Insurers may not be swayed by these points if there's no substantive evidence of unfair claim handling.

### **Do This Instead**

### ***Strategy for Proving Bad Faith:***

- Present the insurance company with the initial decision they made regarding your claim.
- Submit additional information (e.g., new evidence, engineering reports, photos) that supports your case.
- If the insurance company refuses to reconsider their decision despite the new evidence, this could indicate bad faith.

### ***Final Letter:***

- Compile all the specific evidence that shows the insurance company's failure to reconsider their decision in light of new information. This personalized approach, our attorney argues, is more effective than using a generic template because each case is unique.

### **Meticulous Documentation Required:**

- Every interaction and step taken with insurance companies must be thoroughly documented to provide attorneys with the necessary evidence for legal action; failure to do so can lead to claims being considered "dead" due to insufficient documentation to support further action

### *How to Determine the Total Value of the Claim by Reading the Xactimate Estimate*

To determine the total value of the claim using the Xactimate estimate, follow these steps:

1. **Locate the Replacement Cost Value (RCV) on the Summary for Dwelling Page.**
    - This page provides the RCV for the main dwelling without including any code upgrades.
2. **Locate the Replacement Cost Value (RCV) on the Summary for Dwelling - Code Upgrade and Summary for All Items Page.**
    - This page lists the RCV for code upgrades and additional items not included in the main dwelling summary.
3. **Add the Two Replacement Cost Values Together.**
    - Add the RCV from the Summary for Dwelling Page to the RCV from the Summary for Dwelling - Code Upgrade and Summary for All Items Page.

### **Explanation**

The reason for this addition is that the RCV on the Summary for Dwelling Page does not include the RCV for code upgrades and additional items listed on the Summary for Dwelling - Code Upgrade and Summary for All Items Page. Code upgrades and specific additional work are only added to the total job value once they are incurred or completed, as these items are not paid out until that point.

### **Industry Standard**

In practice, code upgrades and additional items are almost always completed. Therefore, to get an accurate total value of the claim, you should add the RCV from both pages. This combined total represents the complete value of the claim on the Xactimate estimate.

### General Overview:

The concept of matching in insurance claims is crucial for professionals within the insurance industry, as well as for policyholders and contractors dealing with property damage, particularly to roofing and siding. Matching ensures that any repairs or replacements not only maintain the structural integrity and functionality of the property but also preserve its aesthetic consistency and overall value. This is particularly important in cases where only part of a structure is damaged, as often happens with hailstorms or other localized impacts. Understanding how to address and negotiate matching with insurance adjusters can prevent mismatched repairs that could lead to further complications, both structurally and visually.

This knowledge becomes essential when an insurance company covers only partial repair costs, leading to potential disparities in material type or color, which can significantly affect the property’s appearance and value. Properly handling these situations requires clear communication, an understanding of insurance policy intricacies, and strategic use of terminology that emphasizes the need for a uniform appearance to achieve a fair settlement.

### *Key Objectives:*

1. ***Clear Understanding of Matching Needs:***
    1. Participants will learn about the importance of color and material matching in insurance claims, focusing on why it is critical to maintain a property's aesthetic and structural integrity.
2. ***Strategic Communication with Adjusters:***
    1. The training will highlight effective communication strategies to use with insurance adjusters, emphasizing the importance of terminology such as “reasonably uniform appearance” over “matching” to avoid common objections and misunderstandings.
3. ***Documentation and Evidence Presentation:***
    1. Participants will understand the steps to meticulously document mismatch issues and present this evidence effectively to insurance adjusters. This includes using tools like Itel or NTS to support claims of inadequate matching.
4. ***Navigating Adjuster Objections:***
    1. The course will cover typical adjuster responses to matching claims, including arguments about non-coverage under "matching state" policies or limitations to providing compensation for “like kind and quality.” Understanding these objections will prepare participants to counter them effectively.

### What Is Matching

- Color matching refers to replacing damaged roofing/siding with new materials that closely resemble the existing color.
- It aims to restore the property's aesthetic appearance and ensure a seamless blend with the rest of the structure.
- Material matching involves replacing damaged roofing/siding with the same type or an equivalent alternative.
- It ensures the structural integrity, functionality, and performance of the repaired or replaced materials.

### Why Does Understanding Matching Matter?

- Typically, when a hailstorm occurs, it strikes property at an angle. So, while one side of your roof might get pounded, the opposite side may have no damage at all. The hailstones might hit one slope of the roof really hard, while just skipping across the other slope. The same is true with exterior siding.
- In the event that an insurance company only covers the cost of repairing or replacing one side of the roof or siding, it raises the question of what steps should be taken.

### Now What Can You Do In The Above Situation? Well Here Are Some Perspectives

- *Clear Communication:*
    - It is essential to communicate the problem in a manner that is simple and easily comprehensible, to individuals at all levels of understanding, including children.
- *Overcoming Willful Ignorance:*
    - In dealing with adjusters, we often encounter situations where they demonstrate a deliberate lack of knowledge or understanding.
    - Carefully choose your language when interacting with insurance adjusters; it can significantly influence the outcome of your discussion.
    - Keep in mind that adjusters may not be thoroughly familiar with the intricacies of insurance policies.
    - Be aware that some terms, like "matching," may trigger an automatic response from adjusters; in this case, it's often "we don't cover matching."
    - Therefore, when discussing issues related to "matching," opt to use the phrase "reasonably uniform appearance."
    - Using this alternative phrase can help prevent misunderstandings and facilitate better communication with the adjuster.

### *What Steps Might You Take To Prove It Doesn’t Match?*

- *Priority on Document Retrieval:*
    - When utilizing an Itel or NTS, the primary focus is on efficiently obtaining the required documentation, rather than placing emphasis on the material or color match.
- *Thorough Documentation:*
    - The chosen material is meticulously documented in relation to its placement against the house. This meticulous approach ensures the creation of accurate records and reliable references for future use.
- *Submission to Adjuster:*
    - The documented photos are submitted to the adjuster, providing visual evidence to demonstrate any discrepancies in color or size. This step aids in substantiating the argument that the selected material does not reasonably match the desired criteria.

***How Will The Insurance Company Try to Respond?***

Insurance companies may employ various strategies to respond to claims involving matching arguments. Most of these arguments are invalid but it is important to understand what they may be prior to encountering them so you can make a proper response.

1. **Argument of Non-Matching State:**
    - Adjusters may contend that the damaged item does not belong to a "matching state," implying that the insurance policy does not obligate them to provide a complete replacement. They may argue that the policy only covers the repair or replacement of items that are identical to the original in terms of make, model, and condition.
    - Why is this invalid? It's invalid because, unless the policy explicitly states that they do not owe for matching, the insurance company is responsible for it regardless of the state. The reason is that they are responsible for bringing the home back to its pre-damage condition. This raises the question: if the home had a uniform color before the storm, why is it acceptable for it to have different colored materials after the repairs? Consistency in appearance is crucial to restoring the home's original aesthetic and value, ensuring that the repairs do not detract from its overall look.
2. **Limitation of Liability to "Like Kind and Quality":**
    - Adjusters might assert that their responsibility is limited to providing compensation for items of "like kind and quality." This approach allows them to offer a replacement or repair that is similar to the damaged item but not necessarily identical, potentially limiting their financial liability.
    - This is invalid because many manufacturers specifically designate what materials qualify as “Like, Kind and Quality”. If we do not use the materials specified by the manufacturer, the warranty may be voided. It is essential to adhere to the manufacturer's guidelines to ensure the integrity and longevity of the repairs and to maintain the validity of the warranty.
3. **Proposal of "Reasonable Match":**
    - Insurance companies may argue that they are not obligated to provide an exact match for the damaged item but rather a "reasonable match." This interpretation gives them more flexibility in selecting a replacement that is functionally equivalent to the original but may not have the same specific features or characteristics.
    - This is invalid because who determines what constitutes a reasonable match? Often, the insurance company will argue that they only owe for a reasonable match, which allows them to avoid restoring the home to its original value. As for who should determine if a match is reasonable, it should be the homeowner, as they are the ones who have to live with the colors on the property. The homeowner's preference should be paramount in ensuring satisfaction with the repairs.

Insurance companies may employ various strategies to respond to claims involving matching arguments. Most of these arguments are invalid, but it is important to understand them prior to encountering them so you can make a proper response. By being aware of these tactics, you can better prepare to counter their claims and ensure that the necessary repairs and replacements are covered, maintaining the integrity and appearance of the clients home.
